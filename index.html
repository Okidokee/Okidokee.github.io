    <h1 class="heading">Directors' Style</h1>

    <p class="text"> <strong>Everyone</strong> has a favorite director whether they realize it or not. Even if you don't know they made certain movies, odds are you still gravitate to one or more directors' work.</p>

    <h2> Spielberg</h2>
    <p class="text"> Spielberg's films attract millions of fans of all ages. He's made successful series such as <em>Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Jurassic Park</em>. These movies have more similarites than you might think. For one they all reside in the same genre, that being action/adventure(with more of an emphasis on adventure). The characters always travel to fascinating lands whether it be a galaxy far away, the Temple of Doom, or a land lost to time.</p>
